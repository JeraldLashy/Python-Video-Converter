# Python-Video-Converter

I created this code in less than 30mins to solve a small task of converting videos to these formats after being bored of converting videos one by one as an assigned task. 

You are open to add Functionality to make the program cover larger base.  

## Prerequisites

1. Install Python
2. FFmpeg

Add the path to enviroment variables

## MKV to MP4

Add the mkv files to be converted in the folder videos/mkv (mkv folder in the videos folder in the same folder as program.)

PS: Run the program once to create the folders automatically or create the folders manually. 

Then Run  the program select Option 1.

The program will run and save the files to result/mp4 folder (mp4 folder inside the result folder)

## MP4 to MKV

Add the mp4 files to be converted in the folder videos/mp4 (mp4 folder in the videos folder in the same folder as program.)

PS: Run the program once to create the folders automatically or create the folders manually. 

Then Run  the program select Option 2.

The program will run and save the files to result/mkv folder (mkv folder inside the result folder)

## Future of the program

### 1. Make the user select a folder without moving the files
### 2. Make the program GUI and executable
### 3. Increase Functionality.
### 4. Make the program identify the file then user selects target format.
